QuickTun is a VPN tunnel software designed to be simple and secure.
It relies on the NaCl encryption lib by D. J. Bernstein.

QuickTun uses the curve25519xsalsa20poly1305 crypto-box functionality
of the NaCl library for secure public-key encryption.

And that's about all QuickTun does; encrypting and sending data.

QuickTun itself has only a few hundred lines of pure C code, making 
it according the author simple to maintain, analyze, debug and fix.
