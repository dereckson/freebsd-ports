lastfmsubmitd is a daemon meant to be used by Last.fm player plugins. It
handles all aspects of submitting data to the Last.fm servers, so that
player plugins only need to watch what songs are played and write a
representation of each played song to its spool.

The format used for serializing songs is a simple YAML dictionary, which
can be constructed with YAML libraries (available for many languages), or
printed ad hoc. The spool is managed with standard unix permissions, and
many different players can use the same daemon to submit. Each instance of
lastfmsubmitd uses a single account.
